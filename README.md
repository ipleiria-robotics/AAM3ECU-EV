# AAM3ECU-EV
Arduino ARM M3 Engine Control Unit for Electric Vehicles

## Overview
This projects represents the design and development of a low cost ECU, henceforth known as Arduino ARM M3 Engine Control Unit for Electric Vehicles (AAM3ECU-EV), aimed for electric utility vehicles. The main contributions of this work are: the AAM3ECU-EV overall cost is low; the parametrization learning curve is fast due to the use of Arduino framework; safety measures are included by means of Bus isolation, outputs current and temperature shutdown. Moreover the Hardware and Software of the AAM3ECU-EV is open source.
